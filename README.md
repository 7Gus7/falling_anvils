# falling_anvils

A little game (currently a work in progress) that has you dodging "anvils from the sky". Built for the BBC micro:bit


December ‎2022 - Present

A small project/game which is made for the BBC micro:bit using their online Python code editor. It is a simple game where objects fall from the sky and the player must dodge them.

- Used a variety of micro:bit custom libraries and employed them effectively

- Worked under the constraints of the micro:bit’s hardware which lead to having to get creative with the implementation of ideas

- Repetitively transferring code from the online editor to the physical device, resulting in understanding the boundaries between hardware and software and how they interact
